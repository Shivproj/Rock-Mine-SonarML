# Rock-Mine-SonarML
 This is a simple machine learning project to predict wether an object detected by a sonar is a mine or a rock.
 The model used is logistic regression provided by sk-learn.
 Dataset has been sourced from UCI Machine Learning Repository Url: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/connectionist+bench+(sonar,+mines+vs.+rocks)
 The accuracy obtained is 76.2%.
 I have provided both the dataset and the notebook with code in this repository.
